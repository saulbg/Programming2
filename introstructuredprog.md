## PROGRAMMING PARADIGM
It is a technological proposal that is adopted by a community of programmers whose central nucleus is questionable as to what it univocally 
tries to solve one or several clearly defined problems.  
## Classification of Programming Paradigms  
The declarative programming language always describe the desired end result, instead of showing all the steps of the work.  
Now imperative programming (instruction-oriented paradigm), in this case the developer determines with precisition in the source code the steps the computer
must take to achieve the result. Is better described as "how" of the solution.  

Declarative
-Functional: When we use this paradigm we will be working mainly on functions, as it is a declarative paradigm we will focus on what we are doing  
-Data flow: define applications as "black box" process networks, which exchange data through predefined connections by message steps, where the 
connections are specified externally to the processes  
-Logic: studies the use of logic for problem solving and control over the rules of inference to achieve automatic solution. 
Unifies terms, uses automatic inference mechanisms and has a logical vision of computing.  
-Templated: This paradigm is based on solving a problem dividing it into smaller problems. By dividing into simpler problems, the aim is to obtain an easier solution.
-Based: It is aimed at improving the clarity, quality and development time of a computer program, using subroutines and three 
structures: sequence, selection (if and switch) and iteration (for and while).  

Imperative  
-Von Neumann: describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with parts consisting of a processing unit containing a logical arithmetic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and a program counter, a memory for storing both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms.  
In summary is the programming which storage the data in a common memory, each memory cell of the machine is identified with a unique number and each program runs sequentually.  
-Interpreted: In this programming paradigm, an interpreter is required and unlike other programming languages in the interpreted language, the source code is not compiled once, but every time an instruction is compiled.  
-Object-oriented: It is used to design applications and computer programs, it is based on various techniques including inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation.
Some examples of object-oriented programming are c++, c#, java, perl, ruby, etc.  

## Methods of Programming Paradigms
-Interpreted Programming:  

-Compiled programming:

Data Representation in Structured Programming Language ···It refers to the form in which data is stored, processed, and transmitted.
Characteristics

Identifiers ···An identifier is a name that identifies (that is, labels the identity of) either a unique object or a unique class of objects, where the "object" or class may be an idea, physical object, or physical substance.
